# CSSToXSLFO

With this library you can convert an XML document that is decorated with CSS to XSL-FO 1.0. The [manual](manual.pdf) was formatted with [XEP from RenderX](https://www.renderx.com). See also the [API documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/net.pincette/csstoxslfo/latest/index.html).

You can build the tool with `mvn clean package`. This will produce a self-contained JAR-file in the `target` directory with the form `csstoxslfo-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. You can launch this JAR with `java -jar`.
